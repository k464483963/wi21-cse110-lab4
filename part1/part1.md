Q1:print out the value 3

Q2:print out the value 150

Q3:print out the value 150

Q4:The return value is (3,150,150). The i print out 3 because the i is using the var and the var can access the value outside the brackets, i is keep counting three times(prices length is 3). The discountedPrice is var can access the value outside the brackets and the value is 150 because it only show the last calculate value like 300 * (1-0.5) = 150 = discountedPrice. The finalPrice is var can access the value outside the brackets and the value is 150 because it only show the last calculate value like (150 * 100) /100 = 150 = finalPrice.

Q5:The referenceError: i is not defined. The reason is let is only can access the value inside the brackets. console.log(i) is out side brackets so the i is not defined.

Q6:The referenceError: discountedPrice is not defined. The reason is let is only can access the value inside the brackets. console.log(discountedPrice) is out side brackets so the discountedPrice is not defined.

Q7:print out the value 150. 

Q8:The program have complie error because the referenceError which is i and discountedPrice are not defined.

Q9:The referenceError: i is not defined. The reason is let is only can access the value inside the brackets. console.log(i) is out side brackets so the i is not defined.

Q10:The referenceError: discountedPrice is not defined. The reason is const is only can access the value inside the brackets. console.log(discountedPrice) is outside brackets so the discountedPrice is not defined.

Q11:TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. finalPrice is assign to 0 and this is constant value and the value can not change. However, "finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100)/100;" tried to change the finalPrice value. Therefore, error message show.

Q12:Compiler error. TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. finalPrice is assign to 0 and this is constant value and the value can not change. However, "finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100)/100;" tried to change the finalPrice value. Therefore, error message show.
